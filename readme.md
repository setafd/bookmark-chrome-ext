# Chromium Extension: Bookmark Dashboard

## Overview
This Chromium-based browser extension replaces the default "New Tab" page with a custom one.  
It organizes and displays your bookmarks in groups based on the folder structure they are stored in.

## Features
- **Bookmark Groups**: Automatically organizes bookmarks into groups according to their folder hierarchy.
- **Quick Access**: Easily open bookmarks from their respective groups directly from the New Tab page.
- **Contextual Opening**: Bookmarks open in a context that reflects the folder's name.

## Requirements
- Compatible with modern versions of Chromium-based browsers.

## Limitations
- Works best with two levels of nesting (e.g., "Other Bookmarks" → "Your Folder" → "Second-level Folder").
- Folder levels beyond the second are displayed as if they are second-level folders.

## Usage
1. Open a new tab in your browser.
2. Browse through the groups to find and open bookmarks organized by their folder structure.
